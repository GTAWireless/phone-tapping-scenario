Scenario Y, 2nd Year UCL EEE, Phone Line Tapping Scenario 
January 2016 

## Design Brief
A small company that is using an external switchboard for its phone exchange would like to monitor their employees phone usage. For that purpose you have been hired to setup an apparatus (hardware and software) to be non destructively attached to the phone line that would be able to give as an output the phone number called. The phone used by the company gives a standard dual tone multi-frequency dialling system and the phone line would also carry the internet ADSL and other signals.
